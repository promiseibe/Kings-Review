It helps us understand the world more easily. Some lists are just for fun, while others can be quite serious. As ubiquitous as any are the \u201cBest Paying\u201d or \u201cHot\u201d job lists, whether general or for specific industries or places. This shouldn\u2019t be surprising since work is such an important part of our lives.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>At <em>Staffing 360<\/em>, we\u2019re no different and we look at the lists too. There are many to review and each one shows something a little different while often also agreeing with data from others. Up to a point, the more you read the better, not taking just one person\u2019s viewpoint as truth. But at some point, it becomes time wasted to look at similar data over and over. Without further ado, here are some that we think are worth reviewing.<\/p>\n<h3>The 13 Most In-Demand Tech Jobs for 2019<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Business intelligence analyst $85-175,000<\/li>\n<li>Cloud architect $75-150,000<\/li>\n<li>Cloud systems engineer $85-145,000<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 240px;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.atrinternational.com\/2019-it-job-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Full List<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>12 IT Jobs with Greatest Long-Term Potential<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Mobile applications developer<\/li>\n<li>Data architect<\/li>\n<li>Business intelligence analyst<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 240px;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.atrinternational.com\/2019-it-job-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Full List<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Top 10 IT Jobs<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Cybersecurity engineer<\/li>\n<li>AI\/machine learning engineer<\/li>\n<li>Full stack developer<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 240px;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.atrinternational.com\/2019-it-job-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Full List<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>13 Best IT Jobs of the Future<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Web developer<\/li>\n<li>Mobile applications developer<\/li>\n<li>Change management<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 240px;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.atrinternational.com\/2019-it-job-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Full List<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What the lists show<\/h2>\n<p>When you look at the jobs that experts are predicting will be in demand this year, and beyond, and you think about the way we use technology every day and the trends that are shaping the future, it makes sense.<\/p>\n<p>A few years ago, the \u201ccloud\u201d was a new concept, confusing to many, and now most of us are using it daily, some even extensively. Is it a surprise then to find \u201ccloud architect\u201d or \u201ccloud engineer\u201d on the list?<\/p>\n<p>How many of us (and how many times!) have we had to change passwords or get new cards because of a data breach at some company or store we do business with? So again, no surprise to find cybersecurity professionals in demand.<\/p>\n<p>The explosion in data means that positions as data analysts, scientists, and engineers continue to outnumber available professionals, and will continue to command good salaries. Depending on experience and skills, compensation can range from $100,000-200,000. Cloud professionals can make from $80,000-125,000+ and developers are in such demand the high end of their range is $175,000 or more.<\/p>\n<h2>If you are an IT professional<\/h2>\n<p>What does this mean for you? Well, if you are an IT professional this is all good news. It can give you an idea of what you should or could be making. If you\u2019ve been at your company for several years, your salary may have fallen behind market rates. A conversation with your current company or a new job could change this, especially if you are a top performer. If you are one of these in-demand people with the skills and experience that companies are looking for you should have no trouble finding work for the foreseeable future!<\/p>\n<p>If you are trying to decide what to do next, whether it\u2019s a mid-career move or wondering what to study in college or whether to even go, job lists can give you a potential road map. It\u2019s smart to move into an area of the workforce where demand Is high; it just makes sense to invest your time and money in educational opportunities that have the best chance of landing you a job! Whether it\u2019s a certificate that targets a particular skill or area, an undergrad or graduate degree, think about the future of the industry and where growth will be as you choose what to study. If you\u2019re already a developer, think about specializing in cybersecurity. Everyone, please, take a look at AI and machine learning!<\/p>\n<h2>If you are hiring IT professionals<\/h2>\n<p>If you hire IT professionals, then the lists of hot jobs are probably not news to you. You\u2019ve spent months trying to fill open developer positions or constantly have at least one open req for your cloud security team. These lists may seem depressing, a portend of where costs are going to escalate, and productivity suffer. ATR \u201chires\u201d IT professionals too \u2013 we\u2019re searching for these candidates for our clients. We feel your pain! But you can look at it another way.<\/p>\n<p>They\u2019re a little bit of a crystal ball. Knowing where there are gaps in qualified candidates helps us discover where we need to invest more resources. Knowing what kind of consultants our clients are more likely to be looking for helps us plan appropriately and build a strong pipeline. Understanding that supply and demand strongly affect compensation, we can advise our clients more accurately so they can offer competitive rates that result in better hiring and retention statistics. This knowledge is valuable to any company and not just because it influences hiring. As we\u2019ve <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"\/training-and-upskilling-digital-talent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">written before<\/a><\/span>, more and more companies are investing in upskilling their current workforce, recognizing that they cannot hire enough to fill all their needs. Seeing where the gaps exist can help you spend your training and education dollars more effectively.<\/p>\n<h2>If you are everyone else<\/h2>\n<p>While this column\u2019s lists are focused on IT jobs, there is opportunity for everyone hidden in the numbers. Other professionals like sales people, account managers, or HR specialists should take note. For example, AI will drive hiring in both companies creating it and those implementing those products. These companies will need all of you to be successful. As you plan your career keep this in mind. The opportunities are not only for IT positions.<\/p>\n<p>The most important thing to remember is that information is power, for everyone. The more you know, the smarter your decisions will be. The more you can plan for the future, the better prepared you will be. The better prepared you are, the more successful you will be!<\/p>\n<h3>If you want to work with a great staffing partner who is excited to work with clients and consultants alike,\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.atrinternational.com\/contact-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reach out to us today<\/a>.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Related articles:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"\/2019-top-it-certifications\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2019\u2019s Top IT Certifications<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"\/training-and-upskilling-digital-talent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">It\u2019s impossible to hire all the digital talent you need; that makes training and upskilling even more important to your business<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"\/stop-treating-consultants-like-staplers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stop hiring IT consultants like you\u2019re buying a stapler!<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Why do we like lists?
