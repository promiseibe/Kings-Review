However, former service members are far more adaptable than you may think, and they can be incredibly valuable to your organization. Consider these four benefits of hiring veterans:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>1. Highly Transferrable Skills<\/h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The nature of military service can be tough\u2014and those who go through it experience regular hardship, change, and uncertainty. As a result, service members develop excellent problem-solving, resilience, work ethic, and the ability to learn quickly. These soft skills can translate to strong performance and adaptability in the workplace.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Many veterans also have outstanding leaderships skills, which means they can make highly valuable contributions as managers. Service members with experience leading direct reports understand the importance of clear communication and bring strong accountability to the table.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>2. Increased Retention<\/h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Loyalty and commitment are instilled in service members. <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.shrm.org\/hr-today\/trends-and-forecasting\/research-and-surveys\/documents\/usaa%20veterans%20report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Over 90%<\/a><\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> of employers agree veterans have the same or a <\/span><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">higher<\/span><\/i><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> retention rate compared to civilian workers\u2014and they\u2019re equally as or more likely to accept a job offer. Creating an inclusive environment for veterans from the interview process onward can help your business improve key talent metrics, all while reducing cost-per-hire and turnover expenses.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>3. Strong Cross-Cultural Communication<\/h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Whether or not service members are deployed overseas, they often work in multicultural environments. In fact, <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.defense.gov\/News\/News-Stories\/Article\/Article\/2929658\/diversity-equity-inclusion-are-necessities-in-us-military\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">41%<\/a><\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> of military members identify as part of minority groups, and local civilians are often just as diverse. Despite the potential for cultural barriers with the full spectrum of life experiences, service members frequently forge strong relationships with their units, locals, and other peers.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Hiring a veteran can strengthen your company culture by improving team-building and cultural competence within your organization. Veterans can also be adept at aligning everyone behind the same business goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>4. Financial Incentives<\/h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The benefits of hiring military veterans include two key financial incentives.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dol.gov\/agencies\/eta\/wotc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Work Opportunity Tax Credit<\/a><\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> (WOTC)\u2014which lets you claim tax credit when you hire employees from a <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/work-opportunity-tax-credit#targeted\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">targeted group<\/a><\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">, including veterans\u2014is available until December 31, 2025.

This allows you to hire a veteran who isn\u2019t fully qualified for a role without significant risk. (You&#8217;ll only need to pay an apprentice salary during the training period.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 aria-level=\"2\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">3 Benefits of Hiring Military Spouses<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">While military spouses don\u2019t contend with the same stigmas as veterans\u2014and are legally protected from discrimination based on their marital status\u2014the level of unemployment they face is significantly higher. Their frequent moves often lead to career gaps and short-term positions, causing employers to quickly dismiss their resumes. However, there are many reasons to <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.atrinternational.com\/what-drives-us\/military-spouse-program\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hire military spouses<\/a><\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, including the following three.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>1. Strong Adaptability<\/h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When service members receive permanent change of station (PCS) orders, military spouses often handle the logistics of moving, helping their family settle and building new community connections along the way. They\u2019re accustomed to change\u2014and they\u2019re often proactive about turning new environments into their home. This level of adaptability can translate to agility in your workplace, as well as strong adaptability during organizational and technological shifts.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>2. High Rates of Education<\/h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Military spouses are a highly educated demographic that remains largely untapped. While only 30% of working-age Americans have college degrees, <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Military-Spouses-in-the-Labor-Market.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">40%<\/a><\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> of military spouses do. Many even pursue advanced degrees and certifications. Companies that hire military spouses can leverage their specialized knowledge to close skills gaps and expand their business capabilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>3. Excellent Time Management<\/h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Military spouses typically have a lot to juggle\u2014work, education, kids, budgeting, housework, social lives, and beyond. Out of necessity, they become excellent time managers who understand how to effectively tackle their to-do lists each day. In the workplace, this makes them high-performers and excellent delegators.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For companies that need talent but don\u2019t need full-time workers, many military spouses are open to flexible hours and gig employment since it allows them to work around their busy, changing schedules.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 aria-level=\"2\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Build Your Highly Skilled Workforce<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Veterans and military spouses bring plenty of highly sought-after soft skills to the workplace, from adaptability and resilience to cultural competence and time management. At the same time, these veterans remain in low-skill positions, while military spouses remain underemployed. Shifting your hiring strategy to target these individuals can help you quickly build a more effective team.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">At ATR International, our <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.atrinternational.com\/what-drives-us\/veterans-employment-program\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Military Commitment program<\/a><\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u2014which connects veterans and military spouses with careers\u2014can help you diversify your workforce with highly skilled and adaptable professionals.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 aria-level=\"2\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Experience the benefits of hiring veterans and military spouses. <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.atrinternational.com\/contact-us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reach out today<\/a><\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> to learn how ATR can help.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pride for our American heroes is deeply woven into the fabric of our nation, but appreciation has yet to lead to inclusion in the hiring game.
