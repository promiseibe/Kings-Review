In spite of this, the value of DE&amp;I is often questioned. When it comes to procurement and supplier diversity, it can be challenging for program managers to obtain the budget and support needed to operate at a highly effective level.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">However, supplier diversity programs are incredibly important to MBEs. We&#8217;ve experienced the difference they can make first-hand. ATR started as a small, two-person operation\u2014which is how most businesses begin\u201435 years ago. Along our journey, we were fortunate to work with many large businesses (including Fortune 500s) that had supplier diversity programs, which proved instrumental in helping ATR grow into the company it is today. These corporations were committed to our success, and they put that commitment into action.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Our experience working with corporate diversity programs across the spectrum of industries has helped us identify what makes these initiatives successful for both parties. These are three key supplier diversity program best practices we\u2019ve encountered.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 aria-level=\"2\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Fostering Improvement<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">The best supplier diversity programs help MBEs become better businesses. Companies have high standards for their suppliers, as they should, and want to do business with well-managed, successful companies. Effective programs offer assistance to MBEs to help them meet these standards.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">For example, supplier diversity programs can help MBEs become certified and implement appropriate systems and processes to ensure stability and long-term growth. Companies may offer seminars on their procurement processes and how to do business with them, which makes global procurement feel less daunting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Some supplier diversity programs even provide educational opportunities for MBE leadership, sponsoring them in formal executive and business management programs. Organizations that adopt this practice understand that investing in MBE executives helps them grow their business and become stronger companies, which ultimately makes them better business partners and more valuable members of the company\u2019s supply chain.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 aria-level=\"2\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Networking and Leveraging Connections<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">I was reminded of the value of connections when I attended a recent diversity conference. One of our large financial services clients included ATR in a networking event, during which they introduced us to people from companies in their business network that might need our services. An introduction like this is amazing. Give us the opportunity, and we\u2019ll do the rest!<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Seriously\u2014helping MBEs connect with potential clients makes a real difference. New clients lead to more experience, which allows for improvement and growth.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Encouraging Tier 2 supplier diversity within your organization\u2014whether informally or, even better, through a formal program\u2014is another good idea. For MBEs, a Tier 2 role can be an effective starting point for their path to Tier 1 status.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 aria-level=\"2\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Committing to the Relationship and Frequent Communication<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Communication is the key to any good relationship, and that holds true in business as well. Companies with effective supplier diversity programs remain open, honest, and committed to working with MBEs for the long haul.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">One way supplier programs optimize their relationship with MBEs is by bringing firms on in stages, either with smaller buys or a focus on one division at a time. They recognize that no supplier jumps headfirst into a huge contract on Day One. This is especially true for MBEs, which tend to be newer or smaller businesses\u2014though I would stress that not even an established firm like ATR does that in a complex global environment.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">By allowing time for a \u201cgetting to know you\u201d phase, the best supplier diversity programs give MBEs a chance to get to know the company better and establish early success to build on.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This strategy should be coupled with open and frequent communication, which helps an MBE understand the nuances of your company and how best to work with your buyers and procurement program. Programs that encourage more intimate supplier relationships have helped us develop extremely successful partnerships.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 aria-level=\"2\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Develop a Strong Supplier Diversity Program<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">We are grateful for the amazing people we\u2019ve worked with in supplier diversity programs over the last 35 years. Working with these corporate partners has been critical to our growth and success, and I encourage any rising MBE to seek out good corporate programs. If you are willing to listen, learn, and do the work needed to improve your company, the rewards will follow. These programs provide critical assistance to small companies and MBEs trying to break into the corporate supply world, so I also encourage leaders to continue to invest in and support these efforts. It\u2019s not just the right thing to do; it\u2019s also the smart thing.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 aria-level=\"2\">\u00a0<br \/>\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">Ready to improve or kickstart your supplier diversity program? <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.atrinternational.com\/improving-your-supplier-diversity-program-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Download our guide<\/a><\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> today.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The benefits of having a diverse supply chain have been well-studied and documented, proving its positive impact on business success.
