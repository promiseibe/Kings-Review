This is an important milestone for our company. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.atrinternational.com\/2024\/01\/03\/atr-wbenc-certification\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WBENC Certification<\/a><\/span>, which is awarded to women-owned and -led businesses that pass a rigorous vetting process, is recognized by thousands of corporations and government entities.<\/p>\n<p>Becoming WBENC-certified brings a range of benefits for our firm\u2014including access to a broad network of support for women entrepreneurs, increased visibility within corporate and government supply chains, and opportunities for targeted business growth. A strong commitment to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.atrinternational.com\/2023\/01\/24\/diversity-and-inclusion-2022\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">diversity, equity, and inclusion<\/a><\/span> (DE&amp;I) has been a part of ATR&#8217;s culture since our founding, and WBENC certification is a demonstration of our ongoing efforts in this area. I\u2019m really proud of our team!<\/p>\n<h2>Leading by Example as a WBENC-Certified Women&#8217;s Business Enterprise<\/h2>\n<p>The benefits mentioned above are just one part of the story. For me, it goes beyond the tangible. Of course, I am happy to have more visibility and opportunity, especially with corporate and government buyers, but I am also looking forward to sharing our experiences with others.<\/p>\n<p>A key part of our <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.atrinternational.com\/diversity\/diversity-and-inclusion-at-atr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DE&amp;I commitment<\/a><\/span> is serving as a role model and sharing what we\u2019ve learned in <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.atrinternational.com\/2023\/09\/14\/leadership-insights\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">35 years of business<\/a><\/span> as a minority- and woman-owned business. Giving back is as important and beneficial as receiving. Whether we\u2019ll be sharing information, making an introduction or recommendation, or simply supporting a fellow business owner with words of encouragement, I know these moments will be meaningful and important to me. I hope they\u2019ll be beneficial to others, too. Our goal has always been to be a leader in DE&amp;I, and this new certification will help us continue toward that goal.<\/p>\n<p>I have been lucky to have many wonderful mentors throughout my career. Teachers, coworkers, colleagues, fellow business owners, and (of course) my parents who founded ATR\u2014many people have helped me learn, grow, and achieve greater success. As I&#8217;ve become a more seasoned executive, I\u2019ve been committed to doing the same for others. This is not to say that I don\u2019t have more to learn myself\u2014I do! I plan to continue listening and learning. But I also know how rewarding it is to help others, and how I learn and benefit when I\u2019m doing so.<\/p>\n<p>I know that our company is strong because we have embraced and nurtured diverse talent in our own ranks, as well as in our business of putting people to work. I\u2019m proud to be a Hispanic woman business owner, and I\u2019m pleased to work alongside a team of incredible women in leadership roles at ATR. We want to continue to lead by example and help through intentional, purposeful action.<\/p>\n<h2>Expanding Your Professional Network<\/h2>\n<p>Our WBENC Certification is new, but we\u2019ve been certified through the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) and affiliated with the National Hispanic Chamber of Commerce for years. These organizations have been very helpful in ATR\u2019s growth and success, which is how I know that WBENC will play a similar role and contribute to similar results as we move into the future.<\/p>\n<p>I strongly encourage other women and minority business owners to join. Whatever certifications you qualify for can truly help your company achieve next-level success. The support from and camaraderie with other owners, coupled with the practical benefits of greater visibility with corporate buyers, is powerful. Yes, it\u2019s a process, and yes, it takes time and effort, but please, take advantage of it!<\/p>\n<h3>Want to know more?
