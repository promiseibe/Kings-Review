Internship. Internship.<\/p>\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">By now you\u2019ve had a hundred different things about internships drilled into your head. While it\u2019s great that college internships are on your radar, the plan for landing one can start to feel confusing or overwhelming when so many voices, articles, and tips are spinning through your mind.<\/p>\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">While there\u2019s a lot that can be said about internships, the important things to focus on can be spelled out in just five minutes.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"zw-paragraph heading2\" data-header=\"2\" data-hd-info=\"2\" data-keep-line-info=\"true\">Understand Why Internships Matter<\/h2>\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">An internship might feel like some sort of prerequisite that you have to do whether or not you think it actually matters, but this is not the right mentality. It\u2019s important to first understand that\u00a0internships do matter to your future career. This thought will give you the\u00a0right mindset for finding and thriving in one.<\/p>\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">But don\u2019t take my word for it, just look at the stats. College students who have an internship are\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/news.gallup.com\/opinion\/gallup\/222497\/why-colleges-internships-requirement.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2x as likely<\/a><\/span> to get a job after school. The only\u00a0other\u00a0factor that has that massive an impact on your marketability is finishing your program. Even if the internships you find are unpaid, and\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.chronicle.com\/article\/What-s-Wrong-With-Required\/242727\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">40% of them<\/a><\/span> are, remember they aren\u2019t permanent. They are the stepping stone to the job and paychecks you want to be in for the next thirty years.<\/p>\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">Then, there\u2019s the fact that\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.collegerecruiter.com\/blog\/2015\/09\/04\/what-percentage-of-college-students-graduate-with-at-least-one-internship\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">75% of college students<\/a><\/span> graduate with at least one internship. Imagine that you\u2019ve graduated and are interviewing for your post-college dream job. You\u2019re up against a handful of others with similar degrees and backgrounds, but they have internships and you don\u2019t. It\u2019s a hard truth, but employers are going to choose the other candidates in almost every case.<\/p>\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">If it still feels like landing an internship is more of a requirement than a desire,\u00a0think of it this way. Internships are there for you to learn what a potential career path is like. Sitting in a classroom can feel conceptual, and working on an imaginary company\u2019s project in a lecture hall is very different from stepping into an office where real-world goals and profits are on the line. An internship will help you determine if you even like the work while you still have time to change your major. Plus, internships are an opportunity to prove yourself. They show potential employers that you can be reliable and professional in the real world.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"zw-paragraph heading2\" data-header=\"2\" data-hd-info=\"2\" data-keep-line-info=\"true\">What\u2019s a Microinternship?<\/h2>\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">The idea of what an internship looks like has changed over the years. Today, many internships are going deeper than before. Rather than just delivering coffee and taking notes, students like you are being put on real business tasks and producing tangible deliverables.<\/p>\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">As this type of real-world work experience evolves, the idea of\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.shrm.org\/resourcesandtools\/hr-topics\/talent-acquisition\/pages\/microinternships-offer-new-college-to-career-path.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">microinternships<\/a><\/span> is gaining ground. Like it sounds, a microinternship is similar to a normal internship but takes place in a shorter time frame than a full semester or summer. These are typically focused on one project that can take anywhere from five to 40 hours over a span of a few days to a few weeks.<\/p>\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">Microinternships can change your entire idea of what\u2019s possible. At least 150 colleges give credit after completing a certain number of microinternships, making them just as valuable as traditional internships in every respect. Think of them as a buffet of job experience; you can get a taste of many different types\u00a0of career paths very quickly. The limited time frame also means that employers out there who aren\u2019t hiring traditional interns will be more likely to consider a shorter, non-traditional arrangement.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"zw-paragraph heading2\" data-header=\"2\" data-hd-info=\"2\" data-keep-line-info=\"true\">How to Find an Internship<\/h2>\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">Getting into the right frame of mind and understanding the types of internships out there today is the majority of the battle when seeking an internship. Now, all you have to do is\u00a0communicate your intentions to every single person you can.<\/p>\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">Use every resource at your disposal. Talk to administrators, counselors, and instructors at your school. Speak to classmates, friends, and relatives. Pick the brain of anyone who might potentially know of an internship opportunity or connect you with a business and help you grow your professional network.<\/p>\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">Get active on LinkedIn, and start reaching out to companies. Even if they aren\u2019t advertising internships, it can\u2019t hurt to ask. You may be able to create a microinternship with them or, at the very least, you\u2019ll have made a new connection that could come in handy in the future.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">Throughout it all, be strong and clear with your intent. Let these individuals know what you\u2019re studying and where you\u2019d like your early career to go. At the same time, be flexible and open to different ideas that might come up. It can feel intimidating to have these conversations, but doing so proves you have initiative and passion, and those are two of the most valuable traits in any job seeker.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"zw-paragraph heading2\" data-header=\"2\" data-hd-info=\"2\" data-keep-line-info=\"true\">The Internship Mantra<\/h2>\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">You might be reading this on campus, waiting for your next class to start, or you might be reading it two years after graduating while wondering how to change your career path. While internships are often associated with your time in college, they are just as valuable after you graduate. If you\u2019re ever unsure what position to go after or need a spark in your job search, turn to that age-old mantra in your head: Internship. Internship. Internship.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"zw-paragraph heading3\" data-header=\"3\" data-hd-info=\"3\" data-keep-line-info=\"true\">Need someone to talk to about your professional future?\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.atrinternational.com\/contact-us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">We\u2019d love to chat with you<\/span><\/a>.<\/h3>\n<h3 class=\"zw-paragraph\"><span class=\"EOP\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\" data-textformat=\"{&quot;fw&quot;:&quot;bold&quot;}\"><strong>Related Articles<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.atrinternational.com\/2018\/11\/06\/use-what-you-learned-in-college-on-the-job\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Use What You Learned in College on The Job<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.atrinternational.com\/2019\/07\/02\/rise-academy-career-discussion\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ATR Participates in Career Discussion at Oakland\u2019s RISE Academy<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.atrinternational.com\/2016\/05\/17\/beyond-what-you-say-why-its-important-to-pay-attention-to-body-language\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Job Interview \u2013 Everything You Need to Know About Body Language<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Internship.
